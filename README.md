Hello there! I'm Natan, a 21 years old student currently graduating in Computing Engineering. Through my years in college I have been in contact with several fields of study, programming languages and plataforms. So far, my favorite computing topics are:
- 🚍 Optimization Problems and Techniques
- 🤖 Machine Learning
- 📚 Data Science
- ⛳ Algorithm Design

By the way, I'm a newbie and enthusiast in Python, and the programming languages which I'm most profficient are: C, Java, Matlab Scripts and more recently Python. I also know the basics of web programming, mobile development, relational databases and signal processing techniques.
 
 In my free time, I like to:
 - 📘 Read old books
 - 🎧 Listen to music
 - 🎥 Watch nerdy stuff
 - ☕ Drink coffee. LOTS of coffee
 
I have great interest in contributting to open source projects in various areas, mainly with back-end programming and software engineering. If I don't have the knowledge of the field or the language you are dealing with, even better: that's an oportunity to learn new things. Feel free to contact me!
